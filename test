Allogeneic cell therapy relies on donor cells to treat many patients. [2] Ex vivo \ngene therapy means that the targeted cells are removed from the patient and gene therapy is administered to the cells in vitro \nbefore they are returned to the patient's body. In vivo gene therapy means that therapy is administered directly to the patient.
