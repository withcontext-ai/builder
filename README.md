# Context Builder

_Turn AI app development into clicks, no coding skills required_

## What is Context Builder and why do we want to build it?

Following the release of the Low-Level Machine (LLM), numerous tools primarily designed for engineers, such as Flowise and Langflow, have surfaced in the no-code/low-code sphere. Yet, we believe that the crux of AI applications lies in domain knowledge and problem context. Harnessing this belief, we envision a world where anyone, not just engineers, can create customized AI applications relevant to their unique context.

To turn this vision into reality, an improved tool is essential. That's where our project, 'Context Builder', comes into play. The aim is to democratize the creation of AI applications by offering a tool that is not only powerful but also accessible to all.

Our project is guided by the following principles:

- Absolute No-Code: No coding knowledge required.
- User-Friendly: Simplicity and ease of use are key.

We believe LLM will dramatically decrease the requirements to build AI apps and ultimately any individual could use tools to build the AI application, and that's what we want to build.

If there is already an issue logged, feel free to upvote it by adding a¬†üëç¬†[reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). If you would like to [submit a new issue](https://github.com/withcontext-ai/builder/issues/new/choose), please fill out our Issue Template to the best of your ability so we can accurately understand your report.

### Good first issues

We have a list of¬†[good first issues](https://github.com/withcontext-ai/builder/labels/good%20first%20issue)¬†that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started, gain experience, and get familiar with our contribution process.

### Building additional features

To contribute to this project, we follow a ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow. Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are a maintainer.

First, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/withcontext-ai/builder/fork).

Then clone your GitHub forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/builder.git
```
